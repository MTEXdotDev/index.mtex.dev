# index.mtex.dev

This repository serves as the "Source of Truth" for the mtex.dev ecosystem. It maintains a structured registry of all active domains, subdomains, and external assets managed by mtex.dev.

## Purpose
- **Discovery:** Provides a centralized list of all public and internal service endpoints.
- **Manifest:** Offers machine-readable (JSON) and human-readable (HTML) versions of the domain architecture.
- **Mapping:** Tracks the relationship between primary domains (mtex.dev) and secondary brands (gimy.site, getmy.name).

## Scope
Includes primary infrastructure nodes, legal landing pages, and specialized utility subdomains, excluding internal DNS-server routing and monitoring-only endpoints.
